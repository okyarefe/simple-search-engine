# The goal of the project

The goal of this project is to create a basic library search engine that can efficiently locate and retrieve data from a structured dataset. The application will not only search for specific files but also sort the data using selected algorithms, providing users with an organized view of the information.
a Search engine with the following capabilities will be built:

- Data Retrieval: The application will have the ability to read and parse data from a file (src/resources/data/books.txt) 

    The file is expected to be in the format of Title,Author,PublicationYear 

    Example: - The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,1925

- Sorting: Sorting algorithms will be implemented to organize the data based on user-defined criteria.

- User Interaction: It will contain a user-friendly menu that allows users to search, view, and sort data.

- User Activity Logging: The application will also have a system to log and save user interactions for future analysis and debugging.

- Data Persistence: Serialize and deserialize data, ensuring that user progress and application state are maintained across sessions.
